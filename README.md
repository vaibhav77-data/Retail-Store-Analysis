## 📝 Project Overview

In this project, I have developed an interactive **Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard** to visualize and analyze key sales metrics from a retail dataset. This dataset includes essential business columns such as:

- **Invoice**
- **Stock Code**
- **Product Description**
- **Quantity**
- **Invoice Date**
- **Customer ID**
- **Price**
- **Country**
- **Sales Amount** *(calculated as `Price × Quantity`)*

The dashboard provides actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends.
